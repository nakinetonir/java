        <b>Privacy Policy (Customers)</b><br><br>
This Privacy Policy describes the way in which bet365 deal with the information and data you provide to us to enable us to manage your relationship with bet365.<br><br>
We will process any personal information provided to us or otherwise held by us relating to you in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. Information may be provided via the bet365 website (the "Website"), telephone calls or any other means.<br><br>
By accepting this Privacy Policy you agree that you understand and accept the use of your personal information as set out in this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy please do not use the Website or otherwise provide us with your personal information.<br><br><b>Who we are</b><br><br>
References in this Privacy Policy to “bet365”, “we”, “us” or “our” relate to Hillside (UK Sports) LP, a Limited Partnership incorporated in Gibraltar (Registration number 117) for Sportsbook products and Hillside (Gibraltar) Limited, a company incorporated in Gibraltar (company number 97927) for Gaming products. We control the ways your Personal Data is collected and the purposes for which your Personal Data is used by bet365, acting as the “data controller” for the purposes of applicable European data protection legislation.<br><br><b>Contacting us</b><br><br>
If you have any concerns, or would like more detail about how we process your Personal Data, you can contact us using <a href="mailto:data.protection@bet365.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Enquiry">data.protection@bet365.com.</a><br><br><b>Protecting Your Personal Data</b><br><br>
Your Personal Data isn’t just protected by the quality, commitment and high standards of bet365, it’s also protected by law. The law states that we can only process your Personal Data when there is a genuine reason to do so and it must be one of the following:<br>
• To fulfil any contract that we have with you<br>
• We have a legal obligation<br>
• Where you have consented to the processing<br>
• When it is in our legitimate interest<br>
• When it is in the public interest<br>
• When it is in your vital interests<br><br><b>Legitimate Interests</b><br><br>
When we have a business or commercial reason to process your Personal Data this is referred to as a legitimate interest. Your Personal Data is still protected and we must not process it in a way that would be unfair to you or your interests.<br><br>
If we do use legitimate interests as a reason to process your Personal Data we will tell you that we are doing so, what our legitimate interests are and provide you with a method to raise any questions or objections you may have. However, compelling grounds for processing such information may over-ride your right to object.<br><br><b>How long we keep your Personal Data</b><br><br>
Whenever your data is kept by bet365 we will ensure that it is appropriately protected and only used for acceptable purposes.<br><br>
We will keep your data for the period that you are a customer of bet365.<br><br>
If you are no longer a customer of bet365, we will keep your data for the minimum length of time required to comply with the purposes set out in this policy and relevant legal or regulatory obligations. Your Personal Data may be kept longer if we cannot delete it for technical reasons.<br><br><b>Why we process your Personal Data</b><br><br><div style="OVERFLOW: auto"><img src="https://content001.bet365.com/help/docs/privacypolicy/eng.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; "></div><div style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; "><br>
If you choose not to provide your Personal Data it may prevent us from meeting legal obligations, fulfilling a contract, or performing services required to run your account. Not providing your Personal Data may mean we are unable to provide you with products or services.<br><br><b>Information Collected</b><br><br>

Depending on the products you choose to use we may need to share your Personal Data with the third parties that provide those services. Where your Personal Data are transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we require that appropriate safeguards are in place.<br><br>
We may also disclose personal information to other companies within associated or subsidiary companies and to business partners, or successors in title to our business.<br><br><b>Data Transfer Outside the EEA</b><br><br>
We will only transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA where: <br><br>
• You have given your explicit consent, or<br>

If we do transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA, within the group or to our business partners, we will take measures to ensure it is protected to the same standards as it would be within the EEA by relying on one of the following: <br><br>
• The country that is receiving your Personal Data has been found by the European Commission to offer the same level of protection as the EEA. More information can be found <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en" target="_self">on the European Commission Justice website.</a><br>
• We will use contracts that require the recipient to protect your Personal Data to the same standards as it would be within the EEA<br>
• Where the transfer is to the USA and the recipient is registered with Privacy Shield. Privacy Shield is a framework that ensures Personal Data is protected to a level approved by the EU. Read more about Privacy Shield <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en" target="_self">on the European Commission Justice website.</a><br><br>
In some instances we may be compelled by law to disclose your Personal Data to a third party and may have limited control over how it is protected by that party.<br><br><b>Your rights over your Personal Data</b><br><br>
