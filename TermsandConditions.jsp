1.1 You may only bet/wager with the amount of cleared funds held in your account. Accordingly, if you want to place bets or participate in gaming, you must deposit monies into your account. Further details of how to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds can be found at <a href="http://help.bet365.com/en/payments" target="_self">Deposits/Withdrawals</a>.<br><br>

1.2 By depositing funds into your account, you direct us and we agree to hold them, along with any winnings, for the sole and specific purpose of using them (i) to place your sporting and gaming stakes; and (ii) settling any fees or charges that you might incur in connection with the use of our services (Purpose). We shall be entitled to suspend or close your account if we reasonably consider or have reason to believe that you are depositing funds without any intention to place sporting and/or gaming stakes. In such circumstances we may also report this to relevant authorities.<br><br>

1.3 For payment methods that require a specific account holder, you should only deposit funds into your gambling account from a source where you are the named account holder. In such cases where bet365 identify that the named account holder differs from that which bet365 hold, we reserve the right to treat any deposits into the gambling account as being invalid (and any winnings arising from such deposit as void).<br><br>

1.4 All funds that we hold for you are held in separate designated customer bank accounts to be used solely for the Purpose and the bank has acknowledged this. We must return the funds to you if they are not used for the Purpose.<br><br>

The bank has acknowledged that your funds are held in those accounts solely for the Purpose. The bank has confirmed that it will not mix customers’ funds in those accounts with any other, including our own, and that it has no claim on the funds itself.<br><br>

In view of the above, in the event of our insolvency, your funds are protected. The funds would still belong to you and would not fall into the hands of the liquidator. This level of protection meets the British Gambling Commission’s medium protection criteria set out in its <a href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx" target="popup" onclick="window.open('http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx','popup','width=1000,height=1000,scrollbars=yes'); return false;">customer funds rating system</a>.<br><br>

1.5 You agree that we shall be entitled to retain any interest which might accrue on monies held in your bet365 account.<br><br>

1.6 No credit will be offered by any employee of bet365, and all bets must be supported by sufficient funds in the customer account. bet365 reserves the right to void any bet/wager which may have inadvertently been accepted when the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the bet/wager. Should funds be credited to a customer's account in error it is the customer's responsibility to inform bet365 without delay. bet365 will recover such funds by account adjustment.<br><br>

1.7 Unless otherwise stated, all examples given on the Website are given in Pounds Sterling. For any transaction which requires a currency exchange, the applicable exchange rate will be the mid-rate as quoted by the Financial Times. The currency options available are listed in Appendix One to these Terms and Conditions and on the Website. <br><br>

1.8 Once a currency is selected, funds are deposited, wagered and winnings paid in that currency. If you wish to change the currency used, please <a href="http://help.bet365.com/en/contact" target="_self">Contact Us</a>.<br><br>

1.9 You are only entitled to use our currency exchange service for the purpose of placing bets or wagers via the Website (the “authorised purpose”). You are not entitled to use this service for any purpose other than the authorised purpose (including currency hedging, speculative trading or any other currency trading). If bet365 considers that you are using the Website for any reason other than the authorised purpose, bet365 shall be entitled to close or suspend your account and you shall:<br><br>

(a) be liable for any and all claims incurred arising therefrom; and<br><br>

(b) indemnify bet365 on demand for such claims.<br><br>

1.10 In addition, bet365 shall be entitled to withhold and/or retain any and all amounts earned or received by you as a result of or in connection with your ‘unauthorised’ use of the Website including activities which are not for an authorised purpose.<br><br>

1.11 bet365 does not charge for deposits made by Debit/Credit Card, however please be aware that some card issuers consider betting transactions as ‘cash’ payments and therefore may charge you a cash advance fee. Please check with your card issuer for further details.<br><br><b>2. Withdrawals</b><br><br>

2.1 Where possible, all withdrawals will be processed to the payment account from which the deposits were made. Withdrawal payments can only be made in the name of and to the registered account holder.<br><br>

2.2 For most payment types, withdrawals can be processed by clicking 'Withdraw' on the Website, subject to there being sufficient funds in your betting account. There is no set maximum withdrawal amount per day but withdrawal requests for amounts greater than £20,000 or currency equivalent may require additional arrangements. For full details on each specific payment type, please refer to <a href="http://help.bet365.com/en/payments" target="_self">Deposits/Withdrawals</a>.<br><br>

2.3 We have a separate bank account for the sole and specific purpose of protecting money that you have asked to withdraw whilst it is on its way to you. We agree with you to maintain a balance of our money in that account for that sole and specific purpose. Therefore, in the event of our insolvency before the withdrawn amount reaches you, an equivalent amount in that account would belong to you and would not fall into the hands of the liquidator. The bank has acknowledged that the balance in that account is held solely for the specific purpose mentioned. The bank has confirmed that it will not mix the balance with any other, including our other balances, and that it has no claim on the funds itself. This level of protection meets the British Gambling Commission’s medium protection criteria set out in its <a href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx" target="popup" onclick="window.open('http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx','popup','width=1000,height=1000,scrollbars=yes'); return false;">customer funds rating system</a>.<br><br>

2.4 If the value of a deposit is not played through in full before a withdrawal is requested, bet365 reserves the right to make a charge to the customer’s account to cover all reasonable costs relating to both the deposit and withdrawal. If necessary, the value of the withdrawal requested may be reduced accordingly.<br><br>

2.5 If the deposit method of the account is paysafecard and the value of a deposit is not played through in full before a withdrawal is requested, or there is any evidence of a series of bets/wagers placed which results in guaranteed customer profits irrespective of the outcome, or where all the betting/wagering is determined to be low risk, bet365 reserves the right to request a receipt showing proof of purchase of the voucher before any withdrawals are processed.<br><br><b>3. Other</b><br><br>

3.1 If we incur any charge-backs, reversals or other charges in respect of your account, we reserve the right to charge you for the relevant amounts incurred.<br><br>

3.3 You are responsible for reporting your winnings and losses to the tax and/or other authorities in your jurisdiction.<br><br>

3.4 Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you are located. If so, you are not authorised to use your payment card to complete the transaction. However, any bets/wagers accepted from such jurisdictions will stand - win or lose.<br><br><b>D. BETTING PROCEDURES</b><br><br><b>1. Placing Bets/Wagers</b><br><br>

1.3 It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure details of their bets/wagers are correct. Once bets/wagers have been placed they may not be cancelled by the customer. Bets can only be changed by the customer using our Edit Bet feature, where this is available. bet365 reserves the right to cancel any bet/wager at any time.<br><br>

1.4 Your funds will be allocated to bets/wagers in the order they are placed and will not be available for any other use. bet365 reserves the right to void and/or reverse any transactions made after a bet/wager has been placed involving allocated funds, either at the time or retrospectively.  <br><br><b>2. Bet/Wager Confirmation</b><br><br>

2.1 Bets/wagers will not be valid if there are insufficient funds in your account. <br><br>

2.2 For telephone bets/wagers 'acceptance confirmed' will be deemed only after an operator has completed a full read back of the bet/wager details and confirmed to the customer that the bet/wager has been successfully processed and accepted. <br><br>

2.3 A bet/wager that you request will only be valid once accepted by bet365’s servers. Each valid bet/wager will receive a unique transaction code. We shall not be liable for the settlement of any bets/wagers which are not issued with a unique transaction code. If you are unsure about the validity of a bet/wager, please check your account history, or <a href="http://help.bet365.com/en/contact" target="_self">Contact Us</a>.<br><br>

2.4 Notwithstanding the above, if bets/wagers are placed via a credit or debit card they are not valid until we have received payment in full. The bet/wager will be automatically void if we have not received the payment prior to the relevant event commencing. <br><br>

2.5 Should a dispute arise, you and bet365 agree that the bet365 transaction log database will be the ultimate authority in such matters. <br><br><b>3. Offers</b><br><br>

3.2 Where any term of the offer or promotion is breached or there is any evidence of a series of bets/wagers placed by a customer or group of customers (e.g. where common betting patterns across the same fixture/markets have been identified across accounts), which due to a deposit bonus, enhanced payments, free and risk free bets/wagers, Bet Credits or any other promotional offer results in guaranteed customer profits irrespective of the outcome, whether individually or as part of a group, bet365 reserves the right to reclaim the bonus or Bet Credit element of such offers and in bet365’s absolute discretion settle bets/wagers at the correct odds, void the Bet Credits, free and risk free bets/wagers or void any bet/wager funded by the deposit bonus or Bet Credits.

4.3 The 'To Return' calculation available on the Website is for information purposes only, and all bets will be calculated using the stake/risk at the odds accepted. In multiple bets/parlays with a void selection(s) the 'To Return' figure is reduced accordingly.<br><br>

4.4 Should a customer include a non-runner or void selection in a multiple bet/parlay, the bet will be settled on the remaining selections.<br><br>

4.5 Winnings from settled bets/wagers are added to the balance of your betting account. Any funds/winnings credited to an account in error are not available for use, and bet365 reserves the right to void any transactions involving such funds and/or withdraw the relevant amount from your account and/or reverse the transaction, either at the time or retrospectively. <br><br>

4.6 bet365 reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare bets on an event void if we have evidence that the following has occurred: (i) the integrity of the event has been called into question; (ii) the price(s) or pool has been manipulated; or (iii) match rigging has taken place. Evidence of the above may be based on the size, volume or pattern of bets placed with bet365 across any or all of our betting channels. A decision given by the relevant governing body of the sport in question (if any) will be conclusive. If any customer owes any money to bet365 for any reason, we have the right to take that into account before making any payments to that customer. <br><br>

4.7 Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, bet365 reserves the right to make bets void or withhold payment of returns pending the outcome of any subsequent investigation.<br><br>

4.8 For events where there is no official 'off' declared, the advertised start time of the event will be deemed the 'off'. If for any reason a bet is inadvertently accepted after an event or match has commenced (other than live In-Play betting clearly indicated on the Website), bets will stand providing the final outcome is not known, and that no participant/team has gained any material advantage (e.g. a score, sending off for the other team, etc) at the time the bet was placed. If the outcome of an event/market is known bet365 reserves the right to void the bet, win or lose. Disputes over times bets are placed will be settled using the transaction log. All times stated on the Website and/or referred to by bet365 staff relate to UK Time unless stated otherwise. <br><br>

THE SUBSEQUENT PROVISIONS OF THIS APPENDIX TWO ARE SUBJECT TO THE RULES IN RESPECT OF THE RELEVANT SPORT, EVENT OR PRODUCT THAT YOUR BET/WAGER RELATES TO. <br><br><b>American Sports</b><br><br>

We accept wagers on all North American sports such as Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey, Golf, Nascar and CFL etc. <br><br><b>Horseracing</b><br><br>

We accept bets for all meetings in Australia and New Zealand covered by an Australasian TAB. <br><br><b>Sports and Special Event Betting</b><br><br>

We accept bets/wagers for sporting and other special events that are advertised on the Website. All such bets/wagers are subject to the rules applicable to each sport, e.g. Soccer, Tennis, Boxing, etc. In a match between two teams where the participants are named, if any player is replaced prior to the match starting, all match bets placed prior to the change will be void, win or lose. Our general betting rules will apply to any situations not covered by the special rules.<br><br>

Where the official result of a market is a tie and no price was quoted for that eventuality, all bets on participants involved in the tie will be void and stakes will be returned. <br><br>

The result of a match or event will be determined on the day of its conclusion for betting purposes, subject to confirmation by the relevant sport's governing body. Any subsequent enquiry that may result in an overturned decision will not be recognised by bet365, and original settlement of bets will stand. <br><br>

If the venue for a sporting event is changed, all bets placed based on the original venue will be made void and stakes refunded, unless otherwise stated. <br><br>

Odds on coupon - For specified sports we have a coupon, listing odds on betting opportunities within specified time frames of the next 3/6/12/24/48/72 hours. Bets stand irrespective of fixture time changes. <br><br><b>MAXIMUM WINNINGS</b><br><br>

The maximum winnings in any 24 hour period for each sport are detailed below and are exclusive of stake. The maximum winnings are quoted in Pounds Sterling as a base currency in order to ensure consistency across the world but currency equivalents apply for actual payouts.<br><br>

Where a multiple bet has been placed which involves events with different maximum winnings limits then the lowest limit will apply. All maximum winnings limits apply to any one customer, or group of customers acting together, who have placed bets containing the same selections, including where placed in a series of bets, at a range of prices, over a number of days using different betting accounts and/or across different betting channels. Should we have reason to believe that a number of bets have been placed this way, the total payment of all those bets combined will be limited to one single maximum winnings payout.<br><br><b>Soccer</b><br><br>

All Other Sports Max payout £25,000 (includes Beach Soccer/Indoor Soccer/Futsal and Beach Volleyball). <br><br><b>Related contingency betting</b><br><br>

Multiple bets which combine different selections within the same event are not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other. <br><br>

For example, in a soccer match involving Arsenal and Everton: <br><br>

If Arsenal are 'evens' to win at home to Everton and the correct score odds for Arsenal to win 1-0 is 8/1, by having the double Arsenal to win and the correct score to be 1-0, a customer would be getting 17/1 about an 8/1 chance, for if Arsenal win 1-0 they would automatically have won the match. <br><br>

If such a bet is taken in error it will be settled as two single bets with the stake equally divided. <br><br>

An exception to this rule is where special odds are offered for the combined eventuality, e.g. First Player to Score/Correct Score Double, known as a Scorecast. <br><br>

When the related parts of a bet are resolved at different times but still within the same tournament, the bet will be settled as instructed, with the price of the second or subsequent selection being determined at each individual stage. <br><br>

For example, a double selects: <br><br>

Federer to win the semi final of Wimbledon; and <br><br>

Federer to win the Wimbledon tournament outright. <br><br>

As the odds of the second selection depends on the outcome of the first, the odds of Roger Federer winning the tournament at the time the bet was struck cannot be used to calculate the double, and the correct odds after the initial selection is completed will be attributed instead. <br><br>

Multiple bets which combine different selections within different events are also not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other. <br><br>

For example, a double selecting: <br><br>

King's Best to win the 2000 Guineas; and <br><br>

King's Best to win the Derby. <br><br>

As the odds for King's Best to win the Derby depend on whether he wins the 2000 Guineas, the odds for him to win the Derby at the time the bet was struck cannot be used to calculate the double. A special price to win both races will be quoted instead. <br><br>

In the case of all multiples including selections with related outcomes, if a bet is taken inadvertently bet365 reserves the right to void part of or the whole of the bet. <br><br><b>2-Way Markets</b><br><br>

In the event of a tie in a 2-Way market, where no price is offered for the tie, bets will be settled according to the individual sports rules. <br><br><b>Dead-Heats</b><br><br>

Where selections dead-heat, the stake money is proportioned according to the number of selections which dead-heat and paid at full-odds.<br><br><b>Any-to-come (also known as ATC or 'if cash' or 'if' bets)</b><br><br>

ATC (if) bets are accepted win only on all sports. You can choose to carry forward the same stake unit or a specific part of your potential returns from one selection to the next as we proceed through your list of ATC bets. ATC bets are settled in the order that they appear on your betting slip, until all the money set aside has been used. If the money staked (or subsequently carried forward) onto the next selection is insufficient to follow your instructions, then that selection will be settled in proportion to the amount available. <br><br>

Please note that your ATC (if) stake must not exceed the stake on your previous selection.<br><br><b>Reverse any-to-come (also known as reverse ATC or 'reverse if cash' or 'reverse if' bets)</b><br><br>

You may select any number of selections (maximum 14) in two reversed ATC (if) bets. The above ATC settlement rules apply, but the stake unit will remain the same throughout the bet. For the reverse order part of your bet, the stake from any returns from the last selection on your slip will go onto the penultimate selection etc (i.e. bets are settled in the reverse order they appear on your betting slip). <br><br>

For all ATC and reverse ATC bets, customers have the choice when placing their bet of either Single Action or Double Action, i.e. the customer may choose to stop the bet at a void or Non-Runner. <br><br><b>Rule 4 general sports</b><br><br>

Outright markets (defined as after the draw/official field is confirmed for a specific event), may be subject to a deduction equivalent to the Rule 4 (Deductions). The Rule 4 will be applied, according to the table of deductions (a table of deductions, and further Rule 4 rules related to Horse Racing can be found within the Horse Racing Rules section); with the exception that a Rule 4 of 5 pence will not be enforced. Effectively the Rule 4 will be applied, in the case of participant withdrawals, with odds of 9/1 or smaller. Deductions may apply for any runners scratched from the Final Field prior to race commencement. Any such deductions will apply to the total payout value on all bets placed prior to the scratching and the reframing of a new market by bet365 (a table of deductions, related to Horse Racing can be found within the Australasian Rules section).<br><br><b>Appendix Three</b><br><br><b>Racing UK end user Terms and Conditions</b><br><br><b>Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property</b><br><br>
